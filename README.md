# IMDB - JustWatch
Adds buttons linking to Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services to IMDB movie, TV show, and episode pages

## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox) installed to run this script.

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/IMDB-JustWatch/raw/master/imdb_justwatch.user.js)

The script searches JustWatch for US providers by default. If you live in another region you can change the locale through the Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey menu.
